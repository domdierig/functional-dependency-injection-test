# functional-dependency-injection-test
This repository explores how to design and implement software in TypeScript using a functional programming style. The goal is to avoid object-oriented constructs like classes and instead rely on pure functions and composable modules, without sacrificing testability or clean dependency injection.

The project focuses on architectural patterns, inversion of control, and strategies to make functional codebases maintainable and scalable.
